                        <p>E.g., The team is not following the SDL process and has not prepared a Security Risk Plan that includes an assessment of cybersecurity risks.
                            Without a proper risk assessment, we cannot fully understand our risk exposure.
                            This poses a significant problem for our customers who rely on the product, as well as a reputational risk for our company, its brand, and its shareholders.
                            Furthermore, customer assets could potentially be compromised due to vulnerabilities, exposing the company to legal actions and lawsuits.

                            <li>Causes and events: Specify what triggers the risk and the events that may occur as a result.</li>
                            <li>Threats and opportunities: Consider both negative (threats) and positive (opportunities) outcomes of the risk.</li>
                            <li>Vulnerabilities and capabilities: Highlight weaknesses that exacerbate the risk and strengths that mitigate it.</li>
                            <li>Changes in the external and internal context: Account for evolving environmental, economic, or organizational factors.</li>
                            <li>Indicators of emerging risks: Look for early signs or trends that could point to future risks.</li>
                            <li>The nature and value of assets and resources: Include the type and importance of assets at risk.</li>
                            <li>Consequences and their impact on objectives: Describe potential outcomes and how they affect goals.</li>
                            <li>Limitations of knowledge and reliability of information: Acknowledge gaps in understanding or inaccuracies in available data.</li>
                            <li>Time-related factors: Identify deadlines, delays, or timeframes that influence the risk.</li>

                    <p>The purpose of risk analysis is to comprehend the nature of risk and its characteristics including, where appropriate, the level of risk. Risk analysis involves a detailed consideration of uncertainties, risk sources, consequences, likelihood, events, scenarios, controls and their effectiveness. An event can have multiple causes and consequences and can affect multiple objectives.</p>
                    <p>Risk analysis can be undertaken with varying degrees of detail and complexity, depending on the purpose of the analysis, the availability and reliability of information, and the resources available.</p>
                    <p>Analysis techniques can be qualitative, quantitative or a combination of these, depending on the circumstances and intended use.</p>
                    <p>Risk analysis should consider factors such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the likelihood of events and consequences;</li>
                        <li>the nature and magnitude of consequences;</li>
                        <li>complexity and connectivity;</li>
                        <li>time-related factors and volatility;</li>
                        <li>the effectiveness of existing controls;</li>
                        <li>sensitivity and confidence levels.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The risk analysis may be influenced by any divergence of opinions, biases, perceptions of risk and judgements. Additional influences are the quality of the information used, the assumptions and exclusions made, any limitations of the techniques and how they are executed. These influences should be considered, documented and communicated to decision makers.</p>
                    <p>Highly uncertain events can be difficult to quantify. This can be an issue when analysing events with severe consequences. In such cases, using a combination of techniques generally provides greater insight.</p>
                    <p>Risk analysis provides an input to risk evaluation, to decisions on whether risk needs to be treated and how, and on the most appropriate risk treatment strategy and methods. The results provide insight for decisions, where choices are being made, and the options involve different types and levels of risk.</p>
